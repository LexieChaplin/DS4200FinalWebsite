      <h2>What Was Revealed?</h2>
      <p>Through the visualizations and machine learning models, the intricate relationship between sleep quality, cardiovascular recovery, and workout intensity was explored using real WHOOP data. Several key takeaways emerged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cardiovascular recovery (HRV and recovery score) was consistently positively correlated with light sleep, indicating that it has a more significant impact than is generally thought.</li>
        <li>HRV does not always show a positive correlation with REM or deep sleep. In certain instances, HRV was lowest while those phases were "above normal," suggesting that balanced sleep is more important than just a certain stage.</li>
        <li>High-intensity exercise time (Zone 5 cardio) has non-linear effects on sleep:
          <ul>
            <li>Zone 5 activities for 10 to 12 minutes would maximise both deep and REM sleep.</li>
            <li>Light sleep would be maximised with about 16 minutes of Zone 5 activity.</li>
            <li>Spending more time outside of these sweet spots didn't enhance any of the stages of sleep and occasionally made them worse.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings support the idea that cardiovascular training and sleep recovery are tightly linked, and that strategic training decisions may enhance sleep quality, and vice versa. The timing of around 10-15 minutes of Zone 5 cardio matches most doctors recommendations. They recommend around 10-15 minutes to help reduce chances of dementia. These results show a strong link between this time frame and the amount of optimal REM sleep, also linked to dementia, it induces.</p>

      <h2>Future Explorations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>REM Latency:</strong> Future work could collect and analyze REM latency data, which is important for preventing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a Full App:</strong> An interactive tool where users could upload their WHOOP data to generate personal visualizations and get suggestions based on sleep/recovery trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral Context:</strong> With additional data, future analyses could explore how caffeine, alcohol, stress, and screen time influence sleep and recovery—especially in combination with physical activity.</li>
