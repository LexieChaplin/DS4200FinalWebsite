      <h2>What Was Revealed?</h2>
      <p>Through the visualizations and machine learning models, the intricate relationship between sleep quality, cardiovascular recovery, and workout intensity was explored using real WHOOP data. Several key takeaways emerged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Light sleep consistently showed a positive relationship with cardiovascular recovery (HRV and recovery score), suggesting it plays a more meaningful role than commonly assumed.</li>
        <li>REM and Deep sleep did not always correlate positively with HRV. In some cases, HRV was lowest when those stages were "above normal," pointing to the importance of balanced sleep rather than simply more of a specific stage.</li>
        <li>Time spent in high-intensity workouts (Zone 5 cardio) influenced sleep in non-linear ways:
          <ul>
            <li>~10–12 minutes of Zone 5 activity would optimize REM and Deep sleep.</li>
            <li>~16 minutes of Zone 5 activity would optimize Light sleep.</li>
            <li>More time beyond these sweet spots didn’t improve any of the sleep stages, and sometimes reduced it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings support the idea that cardiovascular training and sleep recovery are tightly linked, and that strategic training decisions may enhance sleep quality — and vice versa.The timing of around 10-15 minutes of Zone 5 cardio matches most doctors recommendations. They recommend around 10-15 minutes to help reduce chances of dementia. These results show a strong link between this time frame and the amount of optimal REM sleep, also linked to dementia, it induces.</p>

      <h2>Future Explorations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>REM Latency:</strong> Future work could collect and analyze REM latency data, which is important for preventing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a Full App:</strong> An interactive tool where users could upload their WHOOP data to generate personal visualizations and get suggestions based on sleep/recovery trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral Context:</strong> With additional data, future analyses could explore how caffeine, alcohol, stress, and screen time influence sleep and recovery—especially in combination with physical activity.</li>
