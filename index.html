      <h2>Why Study Sleep?</h2>
      <p>Why Sleep Matters: Sleep plays a crucial role in physical and mental health, productivity, longevity, and cognitive function. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to a range of issues—from decreased productivity and increased risk of chronic diseases to impaired memory and reduced immune function. According to the CDC, one in three adults in the U.S. does not get enough sleep on a regular basis. Understanding what influences sleep quality is critical for developing healthier habits and improving long-term health outcomes.</p>
      <p>Sleep plays a crucial role in overall health and well-being, influencing both physical and cognitive performance. This project explores the relationship between sleep and key physiological factors, including exercise, recovery, respiration, and heart rate. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide insights into how sleep quality is impacted by lifestyle choices and physiological responses. Understanding these connections is important for optimizing performance, improving health outcomes, and developing better sleep habits. The project will involve analyzing sleep metrics, physiological indicators, and exercise data using interactive and comparative visualizations to highlight trends, anomalies, and key takeaways. Through these insights, we hope to provide a clearer picture of how sleep interacts with daily habits and bodily functions.</p>
      <p>Why it’s interesting: Wearable technology has made it possible to track sleep in real time and gives us the opportunity to study how factors like exercise, recovery, and heart rate variability (HRV) influence different stages of sleep and sleep quality. However, many people track their sleep but don’t know what impacts it or how to improve it.      </p>

      <h2>Project Goal & Key Tasks</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project is to explore how lifestyle and physiological factors influence sleep quality. We focus on the following questions:</p>
      <h3>How do different levels of physical activity impact sleep stage duration (REM, Deep, Light)?</h3>
      <p>This is meaningful because of growing research linking cardiovascular exercise and REM sleep to long-term brain health. Specifically, according to neuroscientists, maintaining brain health into old age requires regular high-intensity cardiovascular activity. The American Heart Association recommends getting at least 15 minutes of  Zone 5 cardio per week to support brain function. Separately, having proper REM sleep latency and duration plays a large role in keeping emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and neuroplasticity. These factors are all linked to lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimers.      </p>
      <p>Exploring whether more time spent in high heart rate zones correlates with increased REM sleep could uncover whether certain types of physical activity may support sleep quality and duration in ways that help protect against cognitive decline.      </p>
      <p>If we can identify workout patterns that increase REM sleep, we may also discover the ideal lifestyle to support brain health      </p>
      <p>Growing research links cardiovascular exercise and REM sleep to brain health. The American Heart Association recommends at least 15 minutes of Zone 5 cardio per week. REM sleep supports memory, neuroplasticity, and emotional regulation. This project examines whether exercise patterns can increase REM sleep and protect against cognitive decline.</p>
      <h3>Is there a connection between recovery metrics (HRV, resting heart rate, recovery score) and sleep quality?</h3>
      <p>This matters because all these factors have been independently linked to worse cardiovascular health. When someone isn’t getting enough sleep, it may affect how well their nervous system recovers overnight, which can show up as lower HRV and higher resting heart rate the next day. Over time, these signals may point to chronic stress on the heart and lead to issues like cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>If this project can find a pattern linking specific sleep stages to heart rates, it could help show how sleep quality directly reflects cardiovascular health—and why tracking things like sleep stage quality/duration and HRV can be important for early detection or prevention of long-term issues.</p>
      <p>All of these are independently linked to cardiovascular health. Poor sleep can result in lower HRV and higher resting heart rate. This project explores whether sleep stages reflect cardiovascular recovery and stress signals, contributing to early prevention efforts.</p>

      <h2>About the Data</h2>
      <p>We initially used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/sleep-cycle-and-productivity">Sleep Cycle & Productivity</a> The "Sleep Cycle & Productivity" dataset, available on Kaggle, comprises 5,000 records with 15 features detailing individuals' sleep habits and their impacts on productivity, mood, and stress levels. Each record captures various attributes, including sleep duration, sleep quality, productivity scores, mood ratings, and stress levels. This dataset was the one we initially used for our analysis. However, since the data was artificially generated using Python to mimic real-world sleep patterns and their potential effects on productivity, we found that it lacked statistically significant correlations or meaningful insights. As a result, we transitioned to a different dataset to ensure more reliable and impactful visualizations in our study of how sleep influences and is influenced by factors such as exercise, recovery, respiration, and heart rate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we decided to use real WHOOP data from five individual users. This dataset spans approximately three years, and has over 2,000 total observations across both categorical and numerical variables. WHOOP is a wearable fitness tracker that provides detailed physiological and sleep data which is ideal for analyzing how lifestyle and physiology affect sleep quality. WHOOP collects high-resolution data on sleep, heart rate, and workout intensity, and offers a very unique lens into both cardiovascular health and nightly recovery. </p>
      <h3>WHOOP Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>sleeps.csv</code> — sleep duration, latency, REM, deep, light</li>
        <li><code>physiological_cycles.csv</code> — HRV, resting heart rate, recovery score</li>
        <li><code>workouts.csv</code> — HR zones, activity type, calories</li>
        <li><code>journal_entries.csv</code> — caffeine, stress, alcohol logs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The cleaned dataset contains 41 columns and over 2,000 rows including sleep metrics, recovery indicators, and behavioral data.</p>

      <p>​The research paper "The effects of physical activity on sleep architecture and mood in naturalistic environments" investigates how varying levels of physical activity influence sleep stages and mood in everyday settings. Utilizing wearable technology, the study monitored participants' sleep patterns, physical activity, and mood over several months. Findings indicate that increased physical activity correlates with enhanced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, leading to improved mood states such as increased energy and reduced stress. This study underscores the significant impact of physical activity on sleep quality and emotional well-being, aligning with our project's objective to visualize how exercise influences sleep and related physiological factors [1].      </p>
      <p>The editorial "The physiological relationship between sleep and exercise" discusses the bidirectional interplay between sleep and physical activity. It highlights that while sleep quality affects daytime functioning and exercise performance, physical activity can also influence sleep quality and duration. The editorial emphasizes the need for comprehensive research to understand these interactions fully. This perspective supports our project's aim to explore and visualize the complex relationships between sleep patterns and exercise, providing a foundational understanding of how these factors mutually influence each other. ​      </p>
      <p>The article "The Sleep and Recovery Practices of Athletes" examines how athletes balance training stress and recovery, emphasizing the critical role of sleep in enhancing performance and managing fatigue. It discusses various recovery modalities athletes use and highlights that optimal sleep duration varies individually, though 7–9 hours is generally recommended. The study underscores the importance of quality sleep for athletic performance and recovery. This research is pertinent to our project as it provides insights into how sleep contributes to recovery and performance, particularly in physically active individuals, thereby informing our data visualizations on the interplay between sleep, exercise, and physiological factors. ​      </h3>
