      <h2>Why Study Sleep?</h2>
      <p>Why Sleep Matters: Sleep plays a crucial role in physical and mental health, productivity, longevity, and cognitive function. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to a range of issues—from decreased productivity and increased risk of chronic diseases to impaired memory and reduced immune function. According to the CDC, one in three adults in the U.S. does not get enough sleep on a regular basis. Understanding what influences sleep quality is critical for developing healthier habits and improving long-term health outcomes [1].</p>
      <p>Sleep plays a crucial role in overall health and well-being, influencing both physical and cognitive performance. This project explores the relationship between sleep and key physiological factors, including exercise, recovery, respiration, and heart rate. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide insights into how sleep quality is impacted by lifestyle choices and physiological responses. Understanding these connections is important for optimizing performance, improving health outcomes, and developing better sleep habits. The project will involve analyzing sleep metrics, physiological indicators, and exercise data using interactive and comparative visualizations to highlight trends, anomalies, and key takeaways. Through these insights, we hope to provide a clearer picture of how sleep interacts with daily habits and bodily functions.</p>
      <p>Why it’s interesting: Wearable technology has made it possible to track sleep in real time and gives us the opportunity to study how factors like exercise, recovery, and heart rate variability (HRV) influence different stages of sleep and sleep quality. However, many people track their sleep but don’t know what impacts it or how to improve it.      </p>

      <h2>Project Goal & Key Tasks</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project is to explore how lifestyle and physiological factors influence sleep quality. We focus on the following questions:</p>
      <h3>How do different levels of physical activity impact sleep stage duration (REM, Deep, Light)?</h3>
      <p>This is meaningful because of growing research linking cardiovascular exercise and resting eye movement (REM) sleep to long-term brain health. REM sleep is a stage of sleep characterized by quick, darting eye movements, vivid dreaming, and increased brain activity. It's essential for cognitive functions like memory consolidation, learning, and emotional regulation. Additionally, according to neuroscientists, maintaining brain health into old age requires regular high-intensity cardiovascular activity. Cardio zones are heart rate ranges that indicate exercise intensity, based on a percentage of your maximum heart rate. Zone 1 is very light activity, good for warm-ups and recovery. Zones 2 and 3 involve moderate effort and build endurance and aerobic fitness. Zone 4 is more intense, improving speed and performance. Zone 5 is maximum effort, typically used in short bursts to boost power and anaerobic capacity. The American Heart Association recommends getting at least 15 minutes of  Zone 5 cardio per week to support brain function. These factors are all linked to lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimers[1].      </p>
      <p>Exploring whether more time spent in high heart rate zones correlates with increased REM sleep could uncover whether certain types of physical activity may support sleep quality and duration in ways that help protect against cognitive decline.      </p>
      <p>If we can identify workout patterns that increase REM sleep, we may also discover the ideal lifestyle to support brain health      </p>
      <p>Growing research links cardiovascular exercise and REM sleep to brain health. The American Heart Association recommends at least 15 minutes of Zone 5 cardio per week. REM sleep supports memory, neuroplasticity, and emotional regulation. This project examines whether exercise patterns can increase REM sleep and protect against cognitive decline[2].</p>
      <h3>Is there a connection between recovery metrics (HRV, resting heart rate, recovery score) and sleep quality?</h3>
      <p>This matters because all these factors have been independently linked to worse cardiovascular health. When someone isn’t getting enough sleep, it may affect how well their nervous system recovers overnight, which can show up as lower HRV and higher resting heart rate the next day. Over time, these signals may point to chronic stress on the heart and lead to issues like cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>If this project can find a pattern linking specific sleep stages to heart rates, it could help show how sleep quality directly reflects cardiovascular health—and why tracking things like sleep stage quality/duration and HRV can be important for early detection or prevention of long-term issues.</p>
      <p>All of these are independently linked to cardiovascular health. Poor sleep can result in lower HRV and higher resting heart rate. This project explores whether sleep stages reflect cardiovascular recovery and stress signals, contributing to early prevention efforts.</p>

      <h2>About the Data</h2>
      <p>We initially used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/sleep-cycle-and-productivity">Sleep Cycle & Productivity</a> The "Sleep Cycle & Productivity" dataset, available on Kaggle, comprises 5,000 records with 15 features detailing individuals' sleep habits and their impacts on productivity, mood, and stress levels. Each record captures various attributes, including sleep duration, sleep quality, productivity scores, mood ratings, and stress levels. This dataset was the one we initially used for our analysis. However, since the data was artificially generated using Python to mimic real-world sleep patterns and their potential effects on productivity, we found that it lacked statistically significant correlations or meaningful insights. As a result, we transitioned to a different dataset to ensure more reliable and impactful visualizations in our study of how sleep influences and is influenced by factors such as exercise, recovery, respiration, and heart rate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we decided to use real WHOOP data from five individual users. This dataset spans approximately three years, and has over 2,000 total observations across both categorical and numerical variables. WHOOP is a wearable fitness tracker that provides detailed physiological and sleep data which is ideal for analyzing how lifestyle and physiology affect sleep quality. WHOOP collects high-resolution data on sleep, heart rate, and workout intensity, and offers a very unique lens into both cardiovascular health and nightly recovery. </p>
      <h3>WHOOP Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>sleeps.csv</code> — sleep duration, latency, REM, deep, light</li>
        <li><code>physiological_cycles.csv</code> — HRV, resting heart rate, recovery score</li>
        <li><code>workouts.csv</code> — HR zones, activity type, calories</li>
        <li><code>journal_entries.csv</code> — caffeine, stress, alcohol logs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The cleaned dataset contains 41 columns and over 2,000 rows including sleep metrics, recovery indicators, and behavioral data.</p>

      <h2>References</h2>
      <p>The research paper “The effects of physical activity on sleep architecture and mood in naturalistic environments” explores how different levels of physical activity affect sleep stages and mood in real-world settings. Using wearable devices, the study tracked participants over time and found that more physical activity was linked to deeper non-REM sleep and less REM sleep, which in turn correlated with better mood, higher energy levels, and lower stress. These results support our project’s goal of visualizing the connections between exercise and sleep quality, especially how movement throughout the day can impact sleep and recovery [3].</p>
      <p>The editorial “The physiological relationship between sleep and exercise” highlights the two-way relationship between physical activity and sleep. It explains that while good sleep improves exercise performance, physical activity can also positively influence sleep duration and quality. The article calls for more research into this relationship, which reinforces the purpose of our project—to better understand and visually communicate how sleep and exercise influence one another over time [4].</p>
      <p>Lastly, “The Sleep and Recovery Practices of Athletes” looks at how athletes manage their recovery through sleep and other practices. It emphasizes that sleep is a major factor in athletic performance, and while the ideal amount varies per person, getting around 7–9 hours is generally beneficial. This article directly relates to our project, offering context on how physical recovery and performance are tied to sleep, and helping inform how we visualize these interactions using physiological and behavioral data [5].</h3>
