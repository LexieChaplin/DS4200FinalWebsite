      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This heatmap was created to identify which metrics are most relevant and impactful to sleep-related factors, helping guide the focus for later visualizations and modeling. Before generating the heatmap, we first calculated the correlations between all available variables and filtered for those with a correlation coefficient greater than ±0.6. From there, we narrowed the selection further to specifically get variables directly related to sleep quality and recovery.</p>
      <p><strong>What It Shows & Design Ideas:</strong> Stronger correlations are shaded darker red (positive) or blue (negative). Sleep-related variables (like Light sleep, Asleep duration, and Sleep performance) are highlighted in purple on the axis labels. Cardiovascular indicators like Heart rate variability (HRV), Resting heart rate, and Workout Avg HR were compared to these sleep metrics.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Light sleep is moderately correlated with HRV (0.48) and Recovery score (0.30), suggesting it plays a role in cardiovascular recovery.</li>
          <li>Asleep duration and Sleep performance exhibit strong positive correlations (0.90+) with In-bed duration, reinforcing their interconnectedness in overall sleep quality.</li>
          <li>Resting heart rate and Workout Avg HR have strong negative correlations with HRV (-0.88, -0.76) and moderate negative correlations with sleep metrics. This suggests that increased cardiovascular strain (e.g., higher resting or workout heart rate) may negatively impact sleep quality and recovery.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong>  We chose to focus on light sleep because the heat map showed a correlation between RHR and light sleep duration. According to research from WHOOP, light sleep is the stage where your body begins to relax: muscles loosen, body temperature drops, and brain activity slows. This stage plays a crucial role supporting memory consolidation, motor skill learning, and emotional regulation. Chronic deficiencies of light sleep have been associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and depression. In parallel, resting heart rate is a well-established marker of cardiovascular efficiency and general fitness. Lower RHR values often indicate a stronger, more efficient heart, while elevated RHR is commonly associated with stress and overtraining. </p>
      <p><strong>What It Shows & Design Ideas:</strong> 
        The goal of this interactive scatterplot was to show three important physiological factors in a single view for easy pattern recognition. The scatterplot layout emphasizes the negative correlation between RHR and light sleep. The blue colors, are calming like sleep, and were intentionally selected for recovery score. Darker shades show higher recovery scores and help the viewer quickly see attribute better recovery with longer light sleep and lower resting heart rates. We chose to do radio binding so that people could explore the recovery scores individually.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights from the Chart:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear negative correlation: as resting heart rate increases, light sleep duration tends to decrease.</li>
          <li>Recovery score gradients indicate better recovery in individuals with lower RHR and longer light sleep.</li>
          <li>Most common RHR range is from 40–60 bpm.</li>
        </ul>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This scatter plot examines the relationship between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Light Sleep Duration, with Recovery Score integrated as a third variable through color encoding. The visualization aims to identify potential patterns in how parasympathetic nervous system activity (represented by HRV) relates to sleep architecture and overall recovery. Data points represent individual sleep sessions, capturing the natural variation across multiple nights. </p>
      <p><strong>What It Shows & Design Ideas:</strong> 
        The scatter plot positions Heart Rate Variability (HRV) on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to 130 ms) and Light Sleep Duration on the y-axis (0 to 500 minutes). Each point represents a single night's data, with the color intensity indicating the Recovery Score percentage—lighter blue points represent lower recovery scores, while darker blue points indicate higher recovery. The grid overlay aids in precise value estimation, and the interactive filtering option at the bottom allows users to isolate data by specific Recovery Score values (ranging from 10 to 100%).</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights from the Chart:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The data suggests a moderate positive correlation between HRV and Light Sleep Duration, with higher HRV values (60-100 ms) generally associated with increased Light Sleep Duration (250-350 minutes).</li>
          <li>Higher recovery scores (darker blue points) tend to cluster in the mid-to-high HRV range (50-100 ms), suggesting that improved parasympathetic nervous system activity corresponds with better recovery outcomes.</li>
          <li>The highest density of data points appears in the 40-80 ms HRV range and 150-350 minutes Light Sleep range, representing the most common physiological patterns observed in this dataset.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>This visualization shows how HRV varies depending on whether someone’s REM, Deep, or Light sleep percentage was classified as Below Normal, Normal, or Above Normal.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>REM: HRV is lowest when REM is above normal — possibly a sign of imbalance or overcompensation.</li>
          <li>Deep: HRV is lowest in Above Normal groups — suggesting more is not always better.</li>
          <li>Light: HRV is highest when light sleep is above normal, supporting its link to recovery.</li>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This grouped bar chart examines the relationship between time spent in different heart rate zones and subsequent sleep quality metrics to further break down the different sleep stages. The visualization was designed to quantify how exercise intensity (represented by heart rate zones) affects the duration of different sleep stages. Each heart rate zone represents increasing exercise intensity, with Zone 1 being the lowest intensity and Zone 5 being the highest.</p>
      <p><strong>What It Shows & Design Ideas:</strong> The chart displays the average sleep duration (in minutes) for three distinct sleep stages—REM, Deep (SWS), and Light sleep—across five heart rate zones. Each zone on the x-axis represents a specific heart rate intensity level experienced during physical activity. The y-axis measures the average sleep duration in minutes. Color coding distinguishes between sleep stages: blue for REM sleep, purple for Deep sleep, and mint green for Light sleep. The interactive feature allows users to isolate and examine individual sleep stages for more detailed analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>High-intensity exercise (Zone 5) appears to have the most dramatic effect on sleep architecture, significantly increasing Light sleep duration (approximately 295 minutes) compared to other zones (which average around 245 minutes).</li>
          <li>Deep sleep (SWS) shows a notable increase in Zone 5 (around 105 minutes) compared to lower intensity zones (averaging 85-90 minutes), suggesting high-intensity exercise may promote greater recovery during sleep.</li>
          <li>REM sleep remains relatively stable across Zones 1-3 (approximately 85 minutes), with slight increases in Zones 4 and 5 (95 minutes), indicating that higher intensity exercise may modestly enhance REM sleep duration.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <p>This chart uses a Random Forest model to predict how time spent in HR Zone 5 (high-intensity cardio) influences the duration of REM, Deep, and Light sleep.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>~10–11 minutes of Zone 5 activity optimized REM and Deep sleep.</li>
          <li>Light sleep peaked around 6 minutes, but plateaued with more.</li>
          <li>Too much Zone 5 time may reduce sleep duration in some stages — indicating a "sweet spot."</li>
        </ul>
