      <h3>Figure 1: Correlation Heatmap Highlighting Sleep-Related Variables</h3>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This heatmap was created to identify which metrics are most relevant and impactful to sleep-related factors, helping guide the focus for later visualizations and modeling. Before generating the heatmap, we first calculated the correlations between all available variables and filtered for those with a correlation coefficient greater than ±0.6. From there, we narrowed the selection further to specifically get variables directly related to sleep quality and recovery.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Light sleep is moderately correlated with HRV (0.48) and Recovery score (0.30), suggesting it plays a role in cardiovascular recovery.</li>
          <li>Asleep duration and Sleep performance exhibit strong positive correlations (0.90+) with In-bed duration, reinforcing their interconnectedness in overall sleep quality.</li>
          <li>Resting heart rate and Workout Avg HR have strong negative correlations with HRV (-0.88, -0.76) and moderate negative correlations with sleep metrics. This suggests that increased cardiovascular strain (e.g., higher resting or workout heart rate) may negatively impact sleep quality and recovery.</li>
        </ul>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> We chose to focus on light sleep because the heat map showed a correlation between Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and light sleep duration. According to research from WHOOP, light sleep is the stage where your body begins to relax: muscles loosen, body temperature drops, and brain activity slows. This stage plays a crucial role supporting memory consolidation, motor skill learning, and emotional regulation. Chronic deficiencies of light sleep have been associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and depression. In parallel, resting heart rate is a well-established marker of cardiovascular efficiency and general fitness. Lower RHR values often indicate a stronger, more efficient heart, while elevated RHR is commonly associated with stress and overtraining. </p>
      <p>Additionally examining the relationship between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Light Sleep Duration aims to identify potential patterns in how parasympathetic nervous system activity (represented by HRV) relates to sleep architecture and overall recovery. Data points represent individual sleep sessions, capturing the natural variation across multiple nights. </p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights from RHR and Light Sleep Duration:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear negative correlation: as resting heart rate increases, light sleep duration tends to decrease.</li>
          <li>Recovery score gradients indicate better recovery in individuals with lower RHR and longer light sleep.</li>
          <li>Most common RHR range is from 40–60 bpm.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights from HRV and Light Sleep Duration:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The data suggests a moderate positive correlation between HRV and Light Sleep Duration, with higher HRV values (60-100 ms) generally associated with increased Light Sleep Duration (250-350 minutes).</li>
          <li>Higher recovery scores (darker blue points) tend to cluster in the mid-to-high HRV range (50-100 ms), suggesting that improved parasympathetic nervous system activity corresponds with better recovery outcomes.</li>
          <li>The highest density of data points appears in the 40-80 ms HRV range and 150-350 minutes Light Sleep range, representing the most common physiological patterns observed in this dataset.</li>
        </ul>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong>This box plot visualization examines the relationship between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and sleep stage proportions across three classification groups. The analysis aims to understand how autonomic nervous system function (as measured by HRV) varies when individuals experience different distributions of sleep stages relative to typical norms. Data was categorized into "Below Normal," "Normal," and "Above Normal" groups based on the percentage of time spent in each sleep stage.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Light sleep shows the most dramatic HRV variation across classification groups, with significantly lower median HRV (approximately 45 ms) in the "Below Normal" group compared to the "Above Normal" group (approximately 68 ms), suggesting that insufficient light sleep may correspond with reduced autonomic nervous system function.</li>
          <li>For both REM and Deep sleep, the "Below Normal" group shows higher median HRV values (approximately 68 ms) than the "Above Normal" group (approximately 48 ms), indicating a potential inverse relationship between these sleep stages and autonomic regulation.</li>
          <li>The "Normal" classification shows relatively consistent median HRV values across all three sleep stages (50-65 ms), suggesting balanced autonomic function when sleep architecture follows typical patterns.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Figure 4: Average Sleep Duration by Zone and Sleep Stage</h3>

      <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This grouped bar chart examines the relationship between time spent in different heart rate zones and subsequent sleep quality metrics to further break down the different sleep stages. The visualization was designed to quantify how exercise intensity (represented by heart rate zones) affects the duration of different sleep stages. Each heart rate zone represents increasing exercise intensity, with Zone 1 being the lowest intensity and Zone 5 being the highest.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>High-intensity exercise (Zone 5) appears to have the most dramatic effect on sleep architecture, significantly increasing Light sleep duration (approximately 295 minutes) compared to other zones (which average around 245 minutes).</li>
          <li>Deep sleep (SWS) shows a notable increase in Zone 5 (around 105 minutes) compared to lower intensity zones (averaging 85-90 minutes), suggesting high-intensity exercise may promote greater recovery during sleep.</li>
          <li>REM sleep remains relatively stable across Zones 1-3 (approximately 85 minutes), with slight increases in Zones 4 and 5 (95 minutes), indicating that higher intensity exercise may modestly enhance REM sleep duration.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Figure 5: Random Forest Predication of Sleep Duration for Time in Zone 5
      </h3>

      </div>
     <p><strong>Purpose and Methodology Behind the Visualization:</strong> This figure was created to explore how time spent in heart rate zone 5 (the highest-intensity training zone) impacts predicted sleep duration across different stages: REM, deep, and light sleep. We first had to multiply the total duration of time spent in a workout by the percent of time spent in zone 5. We filtered the dataset to only include rows where Zone 5 cardio time is greater than 0, so the regression is based on times people actually hit Zone 5 cardio. From our data, the longest time spent in zone 5 was 65 minutes, however, the average time spent (of the times people hit Zone 5) was only 3 minutes. Therefore, we used a Random Forest model to predict sleep durations based on the number of minutes spent in zone 5.<p/>
      <p>The Random Forest model is machine learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and capture nonlinear relationships between variables. It was fit using RHR and Light Sleep Duration, which were identified as key predictors of sleep patterns. The model was trained on historical data, where the relationship between Zone 5 time, RHR, and sleep durations was established. This allows us to identify nonlinear relationships between exercise intensity and sleep outcomes, as well as, predict beyond the average of 3 minutes, as even the 4th quartile of the data was only at 4.4 minutes. By plotting sleep stages as separate curves, we can evaluate how time in zone 5 uniquely influences each stage of sleep.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Light sleep duration appears to benefit most from around 16 minutes of Zone 5 cardio</li>
          <li>REM and deep sleep appears to benefit most from 11-12 minutes of Zone 5 cardio.</li>
          <li>These results support the idea from scientific studies that people should be aiming to get around 10-15 minutes of Zone 5 cardio to maintain brain and physical health.</li>
        </ul>
